<pre>
Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services -
including(such as) servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, intelligence, and more, 
over the Cloud (Internet).
to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.
</pre>
<li class="text-info text-bold">why Cloud Computing ?</li>
<pre>
We can take any required services on rent. 
The cloud computing services will be charged based on usage.
</pre>

<li class="text-info text-bold">Where is cloud computing used?</li>
<pre>
Cloud Computing refers to the delivery of on-demand computing services over the Internet on an as-needed basis. 
It allows businesses to rent access to computing services 
like servers, storage, databases, analytics, networking, software, and intelligence, typically over the Internet.

<li>Virtualization in Cloud Computing</li>
<pre>
Virtualization is the "creation of a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, 
such as a server, a desktop, a storage device, an operating system or network resources".
In other words, Virtualization is a technique,
which allows to share a single physical instance of a resource or an application 
among multiple customers and organizations.

What is role of virtualization in cloud computing?
Virtualization software separates computer environments from physical infrastructures 
so that you can run multiple operating systems and applications simultaneously
on the same machine. That is how virtualization works.

For example

Virtualization software ‚Ä¶ enables businesses to reduce IT costs 
while increasing the efficiency, utilization and flexibility of their existing computer hardware

The machine on which the virtual machine is going to create is known as Host Machine 
and that virtual machine is referred as a Guest Machine
This virtual machine is managed by a software or firmware, which is known as hypervisor.
Hypervisor
The hypervisor is a firmware or low-level program that acts as a Virtual Machine Manager.
Virtual Machines provide an environment that is logically separated from the underlying hardware.
The main job of hypervisor is to control and monitoring the processor, memory and other hardware resources.<br>

How does virtualization work in cloud computing?


Types of Virtualization:
 1.Hardware Virtualization.
 2.Operating system Virtualization.
 3.Server Virtualization.
 4.Storage Virtualization.

	<th>
	When the virtual machine software or virtual machine manager (VMM) 
	is directly installed on the Server system is known as server virtualization.
	</th>
	<th>
	Storage virtualization is the process of grouping the physical storage 
	from multiple network storage devices so 
	that it looks like a single storage device.
	</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Usage</td>
	<td>
	After virtualization of hardware system we can install different operating system on it and run different applications on those OS.
	</td>
	<td>
	Operating System Virtualization is mainly used for 
	<br>testing the applications on different platforms of OS.
	</td>
	<td>
	Server virtualization is done because <br>
	a single physical server can be divided into multiple servers 
	on the demand basis and for balancing the load.
	</td>
	<td>
	Storage virtualization is mainly done for back-up and recovery purposes.

<pre>
There are three main types of server virtualization: 
full-virtualization, 
para-virtualization, and 
OS-level virtualization.

  <li class="text-info text-bold">Cloud Migration Strategies and Process</li>
  <pre>
  A cloud migration strategy is a plan that an organization creates to transfer all assets 
  in its infrastructure, including data, services,and applications into the cloud. 
  To keep day-to-day business operations more efficient, companies should implement 
  a cloud migration strategy.
  
  Cloud Migration Process
  1.Plan your Migration.
    When planning to migrate to the cloud,
    it's crucial to understand the reasons for your move and 
    which strategy can best support them. ...
  2.Choose your Cloud Environment. ...
  3.Migrate your Apps and Data. ...
  4.Validate Post-Move Success. ...
  5.Rehosting. ...
  6.Replatforming. ...
  7.Repurchasing. ...
  8.Refactoring.</pre>
